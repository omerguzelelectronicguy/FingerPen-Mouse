# FingerPen-Mouse
This project includes the IMU based mouse design, code, and related documents to draw in computer easily.

We are using mpu6050 IMU including digital motion processor (DMP) to detect the movement of finger. Our aim is to move cursor according to the movement of finger. By this way, we plan to create better experience by drawing anything in computer interfaces.
